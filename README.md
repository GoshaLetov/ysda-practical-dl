# Yandex School of Data Analysis: Practical DL Course

This repo is the fork of [YSDA DL Course](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/tree/spring23/) that was held 
in the spring of 2023 at Moscow State University.

Each module contains a lecture, solved assignments, and a link to the original repository. Additional useful sources and 
unsolved assignment notebooks can be found in the original repository.
